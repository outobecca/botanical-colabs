# Botanical Sciences Colab Notebooks

Welcome to the Botanical Sciences Colab Notebooks repository! This is an open-source project dedicated to developing a collection of Jupyter/Colab notebooks for solving common challenges in agriculture and horticulture.

## Mission

Our goal is to leverage data science and AI to create practical, easy-to-use tools for farmers, researchers, and hobbyists. We believe that by combining agricultural knowledge with modern technology, we can promote more sustainable and efficient practices.

## Notebooks

This repository will contain a collection of notebooks covering various topics. Here's what we're starting with:

*   **Sustainable Fertilizer Recipe Calculator:** A tool to calculate optimal, sustainable fertilizer mixes based on soil data and crop needs. (Coming Soon!)

## Vision

We envision this repository growing into a comprehensive library of tools for:
*   Crop yield prediction
*   Pest and disease identification
*   Irrigation optimization
*   Soil health analysis
*   And much more!

## How to Contribute

This is a community-driven project, and we welcome contributions! Whether you're a developer, a data scientist, a horticulturist, or just someone with a great idea, there are many ways to get involved:

*   **Contribute a Notebook:** Have a notebook that could help others? Fork this repository and submit a pull request!
*   **Suggest an Idea:** Open an issue to suggest a new notebook or a feature for an existing one.
*   **Report a Bug:** If you find an error in a notebook, please let us know by opening an issue.

Let's grow this together!
